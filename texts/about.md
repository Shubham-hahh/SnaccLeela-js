# Hey, I'm Crossie!

A soft-hearted rebel with a quiet soul and a wild curiosity. I love exploring the unknown, creating new things from scratch, and learning like it's my second heartbeat. But at the center of it all is storytelling — my truest language, my way of understanding the world.

Whether I'm coding a game world, writing about messy emotions, or diving deep into a random topic at 2 a.m., I'm always chasing that feeling of discovery. I believe in gentle power, emotional honesty, and the idea that creativity is a kind of quiet magic.

This site is my comfy corner of the internet — part creation zone, part soul archive — a soft echo of how I think, feel, and tell my stories.
