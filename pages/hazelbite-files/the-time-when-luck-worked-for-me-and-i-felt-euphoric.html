The day, December 4th of last year, felt mundane. I was with my peers, feeling like I would be the silent joke of the classroom again. The silence of my mind was broken as I heard Mrs. Salen, our headmistress, and our history teacher enter the class. Our history teacher, Mrs. Ruva, announced with a voice both excited and weary:</p><p>“We need three students to volunteer for a local fair in a school which specializes in children who need special care. If you want to take part in this event, please raise your hands!” (I don’t remember that much of the speech since I am writing this now, but I tried to make it feel!~)</p><p>Including Mrs. Salen, who chimed in after Mrs. Ruva’s announcement:</p><p>“Make sure to bring your own money!” (Ok, here? Uhhh, speeches are the thing that I can remember but have a not-so-clear way to even frame it!~ Ehh~)</p><p>There was a <strong>dead silence</strong>; it seemed like <em>nobody</em> was interested in the proposition. Going to the event? It sounded like a dead trend from Instagram. Yet, I saw an <strong>opportunity</strong>. I saw a chance to go to an event that only few people would have. Seeing the opportunity, I raised <em>my hand</em>—the first one to volunteer—while being unsure if I’d actually be selected for the special, unexpected event I hoped to attend.</p><p>Why the disinterest? It was the time when the last term examinations had ended and everyone was hyped about the<strong> boards</strong>. But me? I was the only one who thought of going outside and exploring a fair, even if just for an <em>hour or two.</em></p><p>As the first hand was raised, other peers in my class followed suit. About five hands were raised by people sitting behind me or away from me. I felt awkward even being considered for the selection; my mind was feeling very uncertain, yet hopeful. Then, out of nowhere, the teacher pointed a finger at me and at two others. For a second, I thought I hadn’t been selected. My mind felt uncertain because—would a person like me ever get selected? Pfft. In school events? That was a cruel joke to me. I <em>jumped</em> in my seat and said <strong><em>“Yes!”</em></strong> in a very excited way as I realized I was chosen. I felt a surge of excitement and possibility.</p><p>I also saw the two other boys: Suva (who got into fights a LOT!) and Daniel, who was a self-proclaimed “friend” to both the boys’ and girls’ groups. Daniel was talking with Suva about me wearing a hair clip on my head and coming to the event (it felt like a disapproval of my femininity). There was also a boy named Tolu, a <em>self-proclaimed</em> “intelligent” person, who suggested showing the selected group the way to the event. Mrs. Ruva agreed to his offer, yet I watched Suva and Daniel talking behind my back about something I felt would cause eventual problems in the main event.</p><p>The teachers left us in the classroom again, and the room returned to its usual charged atmosphere of people doing their own stuff. Yet, I had a lingering feeling of being unwanted among my peers. Then I heard Daniel call me. He spoke with a voice of “guidance” and a disinterest in me going to the fair.</p><p>“You would not wear the hair-clip and <strong>go to the event</strong>, right?” (in Bengali).</p><p>I replied to him with a careless and reassuring voice in my native language:</p><p>“Do you even think I would wear my <em>hair clip</em> and go to the event? In an event taken <strong>by the school?</strong>”</p><p>He looked at me and nodded, yet I saw an expression of <em>distrust</em> on him. It was as if he didn’t want my <strong>true side</strong> to be seen in an event of happiness. I sat down and silently thought about the memories I would make, yet I felt a pang of guilt that I wouldn’t be able to show a part of my femininity. I dreamed of wearing a black hair clip on the right side of my hair (my favorite spot) and just being, without announcing my <strong>identity to anyone</strong>. I wanted a part of me seen in a formal event, even if it sounded stupid to wear it in pair with “boy clothes” (the school shirt and pants). I was resigned and reassured myself that maybe, sometime outside, I would be myself in front of a formal event. I knew that whatever I wear in the future or however my body looks, people wouldn’t care much because they have their own lives to take care of. <strong>Was I too stupid for imagining that? Or is it just a dream of me showing a bright part of myself to the world?</strong></p><p>I went through the usual motions of life—the regular shaving of my beard on a body I didn’t want, in a place I didn’t understand. I told my father about the event and the necessary details, like going with the other class (I thought they would be <em>seniors</em>). I still felt lucky that I was even allowed to go. I went to my English tuition and, while walking down the road, I thought of the date. I remembered the teacher said it would be next Wednesday. But <strong>when?</strong> <strong><em>Where would we meet</em></strong>? <em>At what time</em>? These were unclear to me. I asked Daniel for details and got a reply: “I will tell you the details on WhatsApp.” I agreed, yet internally I was debating whether to trust his answers or not. I returned home with the excitement to know more, but also a pang of disappointment. I unblocked his contact only to see the emptiness of the chat window on my phone. In the coming days, I kept bugging him out of sheer excitement, uncertainty, and a suspicion that they were silently kicking me out of the event.</p><p>The week was spent in that state of “soft uncertainty.” I got scolded by my tuition teachers for <strong>“ruining”</strong> my studies, which made me sad—a soft disappointment that my life was a second priority to the board exams. I told my supportive people about the event; I felt I was the only one <strong>truly excited </strong>to go somewhere that might bring <em>joy to my life</em>. The days before the event felt like going through the motions while trying to show parts of femininity that people made me doubt. Some suggested I hide that part of myself or just focus on the exams to “prove” my experience through an external sheet of numbers. I felt the pressure to perform, to hide parts of myself, and never question the path I was meant to go.</p><p>On the evening of the day before the event, I was so <strong>excited</strong> I couldn’t hold back and messaged Daniel again. I asked if it was 10:00 AM tomorrow and got a reply of “Yes” (in Bengali-script English on WhatsApp). I was unsure but still prepared my bag and the money (it was ₹200 in total) given by my father. The day of the event came and my mind was jumping with <strong><em>possibilities</em></strong>. I ate my breakfast and bathed with the most care my skin, face, and hair deserved—my answer to a world that tried to boil away my femininity. I prepared the hot water through the barely-working geyser and ate an early lunch. I took care of my skin, feeling the water run down, using shampoo on my shorter hair, imagining myself as a woman going to an event where she is excited to be alive.</p><p>I got ready and realized I was <strong>getting late</strong>. I took my bag and wore my school uniform. I felt the urge to wear my hair clip, but I stopped myself; I felt I would be judged by my peers and the teachers. I still wore my watch (my first feminine item) and headed out, locking the door, feeling like myself despite the <em>restrictions</em>. I reached my father’s shop to hand over the keys, then paced through the chaotic roads to reach the school. The gate was standing ajar. I worried people had already left without me. I reached the gate and the guard said, “Crossie, that late?” I gave an excuse and reached the area where Daniel and the others were. I saw Daniel helping with a Christmas program. I approached one of the participants, Fiza, to find Daniel. Even though I had a neutral bag, I was hit by Fiza saying I am wearing a “girl’s bag,” which<strong> hurt.</strong></p><p>I ignored her words and reached Daniel. I saw that Suva was missing and figured he would be late. After a while, Mrs. Ruva arrived and called Daniel, Fiza, and me together. She told us Suva was ill and wouldn’t be coming. She insisted on calling a few of my “friends” to maybe take a cis girl instead since we had a vacancy. Tolu was nowhere to be seen; I heard his parents disapproved of him coming because of the distance. We (actually Daniel using my smartphone while I tried to make sure nothing happened to my digital device) tried calling Samir, then Ishita, to get a female member in the group. They all turned the offer down. I felt a calmness that I wouldn’t need to deal with them, yet Mrs. Ruva’s face was edged with disappointment at the vacancy. Her face showed she wanted another feminine presence in the group of only cis boys. (<em>C’mon miss! I was the hidden feminine presence in the group!</em>).</p><p>She went back to work, and I saw a lot of cis boys from the junior classes hanging out. Daniel was talking to them. I watched them and felt like I didn’t understand their <strong>language</strong>, their trends, or their weird obsession with sports. They talked in a social language that <strong>was unfamiliar</strong>. They talked about the same stuff almost all stereotypical teenage cis boys are interested in: sports and random celebrity drama. Their way of being “friends” felt performative—using exaggerated words to show “manliness.” Watching Daniel interact with them felt like watching a foreign language being spoken. This disconnect isn’t new; it’s happened to me before in new environments. The social dynamics of how these cis boys talk has always been a mystery to me.</p><p>The jokes they make, the way they try to put each other down to “prove” themselves... friendship between them often felt disconnected from the reality of actually having a friend. Their social dynamic is a living mystery to me. Am I too ahead of them? I saw Asil, a cis girl, who came and asked about the budget. I told her I only had ₹20 even though I carried ~₹250. I am sorry I lied, but being let down so many times in my childhood and dealing with toxic environments has put up a stiff barrier. Yet, I felt I related to cis females more. Her words didn’t need <strong>decoding</strong>.</p><p>You know this reminds me of trans women having the experience of not relating to men. For me, it is not that we cannot relate to men at all, but when it comes to a wider social group of cis males discussing topics, they have an unspoken syllable of <strong>being told to perform</strong>. They aren’t intimately close, even if they’ve known each other <em>since childhood</em>. Their language and their way of understanding inner emotions is as <strong>hard as decoding a piece of a living, breathing alien software in VS Code</strong>. I often feel like female social groups are understandable for me. All human struggles are valid, yet the disconnect between a <em>casual talk</em> in a cis-male group and a female group felt like seeing the <em>sky in night and day. If you were in my shoes, you would have felt this disconnect, right? The difference between being only an observer to being actually present? </em><strong><em>Would you?</em></strong></p><p>After a while, Mrs. Ruva and our PT teacher, Mr. Yajna, arrived. I and the junior boys headed out through the school gates. I followed her calmly to the nearest auto stand. I saw the boys going slowly, talking about their usual stuff. They seemed to have a food interest in our PT teacher—maybe because of his looks? His hard diet or being stereo-typically masculine? I ignored them. Before heading out, I saw Daniel and Fiza kicking each other’s legs, as if they were playing <em>imaginary football. </em>I and Asil watched them. I thought: <strong>Won’t they hurt themselves?</strong> <strong>What kind of “fun” is this? Why try to hit each other in the name of “friendship” even if the person feels emotionally hurt?</strong></p><p>We reached the auto-rickshaw stand. The teacher assigned me to an auto with three other cis boys. In the journey, I heard them talk about some sports person, an anime I wasn’t interested in, or “coolness.” I sighed to myself; it was exhausting to decode their words. We reached the area; the road was chaotic like many Indian roads around cities like Kolkata. The smell of road dust and excitement filled my nostrils. I got down and saw the boys immediately wander off. I waited for anyone to divide the finances for the travel. I felt sadness watching them <em>not care about helping me</em>. Can people be <strong>that careless?</strong> I asked the driver the price and was hit with a whopping ₹50. I sighed internally, seeing they were too busy in their <em>“group talk”</em> to consider the money. I paid the driver, seeing no way out. I was left with only ₹100 for the event.</p><p>We waited for the teachers. The waiting was the most painful part because I had to hear them talking about those topics I felt so disconnected from. Finally, we got the call to enter. It was a scene of peacefulness. Mrs. Ruva took the lead while I followed, seeing a big drainage system pumping waste into the clear local streams. It seemed so unfair, yet I felt a resignation for a better government. I watched bamboo being planted for a new bridge. Seeing the houses being built and the sewage being dumped made me realize why India needs to change its intercourse of <strong>election drama.</strong> It wasn’t just about the fair; it was about the change of society and the government being aware of the<em> environment</em>. While the boys discussed the fair or card games, I was thinking about pollution and the government avoiding<em> real issues</em>. It is not about communism or rightism, but about being an invisible girl in a sea of people following the crowd.</p><p>Yet, I saw the roads which reminded me of when a village transforms into a town—the absence of chaotic honking. I saw a cat on the road that both I and Mrs. Salen wanted to give life to. We reached the school and were greeted by a kind old lady. We had to sign in. I realized how unaware the boys were of digital addresses; they were joking about putting Instagram handles in the email field, which felt so stupid. I stood there, part awkward and part excited, listening to the<em> cheerful music</em>.</p><p>After the formal work, I was handed three free tickets for games. We headed to play a game of throwing a ball to knock down steel cups. I used my first ticket. The boys around me were trying to think what to play; their decision-making was very performative. One said he’d use money to “win,” another wanted a different table. I didn’t wait. I started the game. The learning curve was a bit<em> problematic</em> at first, but then I<strong> aimed.</strong> The teachers and my peers watched me play. I hit again... and it was a <strong>perfect shot</strong>. I saw the person give me a thumbs up, and I walked away with a ₹10 bag of Lays chips.</p><p>Watching the other boys play the game and just enjoying themselves felt a little peaceful for me. I had a <strong>cheeky idea</strong> of using the rest of my money to buy the same tickets and make full use of the game. I played the game of throwing a ball into a circle, but I failed. I tried another game of memory, which I failed spectacularly (A side note: Ehh, I tried buying from the shop that I was eyeing from the start, but I didn’t because I had a budget of only ₹100 and most of the stuff was over my budget. I felt a little pang of disappointment at that time!~).</p><p>I watched as the other boys played. I was also insisting to the teacher about whether I could buy stuff from this public fair, and I was told to wait. I waited, and yeah... I knew that they had talent, yet they were folding against the <strong><em>script of society.</em></strong> Their hands and movements signaled a spirit of excitement, performance, and hidden talent. I thought to myself: Why waste the talent for social approval? It would be a stupid choice.</p><p>As the free games ended, I decided to use my naughty plan of buying three tickets for a single game and using it to my advantage. I bought them for ₹20 each, and a major part of my money was gone. I went back to the game and returned with two more bags of chips. I thought that my luck couldn’t get <strong>any better than this</strong> while I saw the others playing different games and enjoying the event. Part of me still watched the children sitting down, people eating, and the overall atmosphere of the event, which felt <em>charged </em>and <em>exciting</em>.</p><p>I saw one person taking a set of Migninis packets (I am sorry , which they ate after finishing a bag of chips. I was also offered a packet by Daniel, which I kept for a while before finishing it). Then, I saw a junior win a decorative set in one of the <strong>lucky games</strong>—the centerpiece of the fair. As I reached the stage, I saw people gathering, especially people who were previously busy. I was looking at the gifts and I felt an urgency to play. I asked the ticket price and it was ₹50. I checked my money bag frantically for any signs of that money (only notes) and felt <em>panicked</em>. I even put out a panicking suggestion of <em>lending</em> a set amount of money, despite the distrust <strong>among the people</strong> I was with.</p><p>I saw other people enjoying the games, yet getting the prizes—it was a game of pulling random numbers from pouches and winning prizes that matched the number—almost felt unhappy for the boys. Was it luck? Or was it a disinterest in good items, despite it being a prize? I saw most of them getting numbers like<strong> 101, 67, or 56</strong>... all in <strong>double digits.</strong> After a long wait, I finally bought my single ticket with the remaining money I had. I got to the venue and saw the regular flow of people; some were getting quite useful items, while others got items that felt “useless” to the peers around me. I saw how frantic the organizer was; she was trying, and maybe softly failing, to manage the crowd. I submitted my ticket (the school’s name is Mentaid Fete—very complex, I couldn’t <em>remember it all</em> &gt;//&lt;) and put my hand in the box full of papers. I pulled one out, anticipating something bad. People were looking over at me, teachers were sipping their metaphorical tea, and... I got <strong>number 3</strong>.</p><p>With the depleted items and few prizes left in the catalogue, it almost felt like my only ticket would be wasted. <strong>But 3?</strong> <em>It felt unreal for a second.</em></p><p>The organizer handed me the prize I won in a frantic way. The box said <strong>“Portable Notebook.”</strong> I thought it was a tech product. I was baffled and surprised all at once by <em>what happened.</em> I opened the box, and it was a <strong>water bottle</strong>. It was a translucent pink color, with text written on it: <strong>“Do your best!”</strong> and on the bottom, it said, <strong>“Be happy, Don’t worry.”</strong> Mrs. Ruva chimed in that it was a <em>great gift</em>, and even the other boys <strong><em>admired</em></strong> the art form I had won.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure class="post__image"><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="noopener"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/25/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.webp" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9It3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png 1456w" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:600,&quot;bytes&quot;:210252,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://cutepie802.substack.com/i/183419446?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="./media/posts/25/responsive/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600-xs.webp 300w, ./media/posts/25/responsive/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600-sm.webp 480w, ./media/posts/25/responsive/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600-md.webp 768w, ./media/posts/25/responsive/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600-lg.webp 1024w, ./media/posts/25/responsive/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600-xl.webp 1360w, ./media/posts/25/responsive/b1ee795a-818c-4f3a-97ea-bad1d338282c_600x600-2xl.webp 1600w"></picture><div> </div></div></a></figure></div><p>To me, it was a nod from the universe and the <strong>immense luck</strong> provided by Nayari (rebranded Aura 😜). I felt as if the universe itself wanted to continue this <em>journey of me finding my own true self.</em> I felt very happy, almost magnetic toward this <strong>simple water bottle</strong> which was in my favorite color: pink—<em>symbolizing softness, femininity, and </em><strong><em>happiness to me</em></strong>. The white text and playful fonts reminded me of being in this <strong>world</strong>—the sheer luck of the universe <strong>playing dice with my life</strong>. I sometimes feel that luck, divine intervention, or whatever the force in my life is, plays a big role in shaping my course and giving me the courage to perform despite the pressure of <strong>uncertainty around me</strong>.</p><p>I internally liked the bottle and designated it as one of my favorites to satisfy <em>my thirst</em>. While most people felt disappointment, sadness, or resignation, I felt a surge of happiness, calmness, agency, and a quiet<strong> greed</strong> to keep my prize to myself. I saw Daniel winning a prize that he didn’t want; he was insisting on exchanging prizes as we got ready to leave the event. He was holding a tiffin box similar to the one he had before and a long, designed water bottle in a translucent blue color. As he insisted, I turned down his offer with a firm <strong>“No,”</strong> playfully heading out of the gate like a girl in a <em>pouty (internal), </em><strong><em>defiant sugar</em></strong><em> rush</em> just to play with <strong>his tiny mind</strong>. My expression was part happiness, part playfulness, with a teasing glint in my eyes that almost startled him. He curiously commented on me leaving the fair, and I backed out, enjoying the act of teasing him and defying his requests to exchange a precious object that showed my soul.</p><p>We posed for a picture of all the cis boys holding their prizes, including the teachers—Mrs. Ruva with her beautifully designed transparent glass and Mr. Yajna with his black coffee cup featuring white, wavy designs. One of the boys had a green tiffin box with many compartments stacked on top of each other; another had a cooking utensil for keeping food warm. Someone else got a kids’ badminton set; one cis boy got a bag and a study set (at least what I can remember!~). There was a decorative piece with an illustration of two stylized cats rubbing their cheeks together with a big curly tail on a white background, and another boy got an electrical photo piece of a woman and a small, pink water bottle made of hard plastic. Yet, despite all these gifts, the boy who got the picture of the girl tried to open it and hide it away as if it were a slow poison to him. Is this a performance or just flusteredness? <strong>Why did he try to break a beautiful prize just because of who was pictured on it?</strong></p><p>After the photoshoot, we finished some of our food, but I still saw that hint of performance—that need to “prove” themselves to one another—and felt the weight of being the only<em> invisible girl</em> in the group. They were making embarrassing sexual comments and finding useless sexual meanings in a simple, secluded area of the fair. They talked about money, marks, and more sexual comments. I was there with my own part of <strong>femininity</strong>, looking at the bag where I kept my <strong>new possession</strong>, thinking about how the universe decided to roll the dice to give me such a <em>memorable item</em> to take with me. A simple item for drinking would be so gender-affirming for me; I couldn’t have imagined a fair would do that for the only ticket I spent. I was left with myself, my bottle, and the environment.</p><p>We finally decided to exit. We said farewell to the kind lady on the Mentaid Fete staff who had welcomed us. The walk back felt as lonely as can be because the cis boys were still complaining about their prizes, saying things like shaving body hair (referring to a student there) is an act of “shame.” (Yet shaving would feel freeing for any person, but it isn’t a simple act for me. It is an act of reclaiming my true self in an environment where I am the outsider, the “other”). I saw the boys running around, misbehaving on the road, greeting friends they saw with a social language I didn’t understand. I only understood the familiarity and the peer-pressure of their own class.</p><p>Going home and resting reminded me how lucky I am. Despite the world not <em>knowing my truth</em>, the universe gave me a nod of <strong>approval to be happy</strong>—to not worry about what people tell me or follow the regular script of Indian society just to look <strong>“normal” and avoid risks</strong>. It would be boring, wouldn’t it? You don’t get a life if you aren’t being your authentic self or thinking about the complex issues of our time. Rote learning a concept, clearing government exams, getting a job, getting married to a person you don’t feel a connection to, and never being able to choose your own gender... me having the guts to defy all that by being myself is ironic, <strong>isn’t it?~</strong> Maybe the universe decided to make me this<strong> lucky for a reason!</strong></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-time-when-luck-worked-for-me-and-i-felt-euphoric.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-time-when-luck-worked-for-me-and-i-felt-euphoric.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-time-when-luck-worked-for-me-and-i-felt-euphoric.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=The%20Time%20When%20Luck%20Worked%20for%20Me%20and%20I%20Felt%20Euphoric!%C2%A0&amp;url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-time-when-luck-worked-for-me-and-i-felt-euphoric.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%20Time%20When%20Luck%20Worked%20for%20Me%20and%20I%20Felt%20Euphoric!%C2%A0 %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-time-when-luck-worked-for-me-and-i-felt-euphoric.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area"><div class="post__inner"></div></div><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2026-01-30T22:47" class="date">January 30, 2026</time><h2><a href="./akera-devlog-1-when-one-world-fades-another-begins.html">Akera Devlog #1 — When One World Fades, Another Begins</a></h2></header><a href="./akera-devlog-1-when-one-world-fades-another-begins.html" class="image fit"><img src="./media/posts/5/f31e06c2-c887-40d4-85de-61e3564d2892_1280x626.webp" srcset="./media/posts/5/responsive/f31e06c2-c887-40d4-85de-61e3564d2892_1280x626-xs.webp 300w, ./media/posts/5/responsive/f31e06c2-c887-40d4-85de-61e3564d2892_1280x626-sm.webp 480w, ./media/posts/5/responsive/f31e06c2-c887-40d4-85de-61e3564d2892_1280x626-md.webp 768w, ./media/posts/5/responsive/f31e06c2-c887-40d4-85de-61e3564d2892_1280x626-lg.webp 1024w, ./media/posts/5/responsive/f31e06c2-c887-40d4-85de-61e3564d2892_1280x626-xl.webp 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="626" width="1280" alt=""></a><p>Since my last post I have been busy and working on… something that wasn’t meant to be a “project.” It&hellip;</p></article></div></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>~ Powered by cuteness ~</li><li>Work In Progress!</li></ul><p> </p></footer></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><script src="./media/plugins/pagePrefetching/quicklink.umd.js"></script><script>window.addEventListener('load', () => {
