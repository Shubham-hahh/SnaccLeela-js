Like people are just going through the motions, not really thinking or feeling deeply? I want to talk about what it truly means to wake up and rebel within that kind of world. In simple terms, consciousness is being aware of the world outside of you. It means understanding your thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and experiences. Rebellion, on the other hand, is an act of resistance—often against an established system, rule, or leader. We're usually taught to think of rebellion as something loud: protests, revolutions, or physical acts of defiance. But have you ever thought about how rebellion connects to consciousness? When a person is truly awake in a sleeping world, that awareness itself becomes a rebellion. Rebellion isn’t always external—it can be a quiet but powerful stand against beliefs, systems, or norms that everyone around you follows blindly. Consciousness and rebellion have always been linked, whether it's about seeing the truth in the world around you or refusing to live by a belief just because society says you should.</p><hr><h2>~What’s a Sleeping Society?</h2><p>A sleeping society is one where people are, in a sense, “asleep.” Here, the term "asleep" doesn’t mean physically resting—it means people have lost the ability to question the world around them. They ignore the social evils happening right in front of them, blindly follow traditions, and pass down beliefs without ever asking <em>why</em>. You might think, “Well, if they’re asleep, they should just wake up, right?”</p><p>Nope. It’s not that easy—especially when this behavior is happening on a massive scale. When a whole society starts moving on autopilot, waking up becomes the hardest thing to do. Have you ever felt that urge to just turn off your brain and keep doom-scrolling on social media? Or believed a piece of fake news because everyone else did? Or gone through your daily routine without knowing<em> why</em> you’re doing it—why you’re chasing a certain career, money, or approval? Yeah, those are the signs of a sleeping society. It conditions people to act like robots—programmed by fear of the unknown, resistance to change, or the pressure to fit in.</p><p>It’s like being blindfolded, walking down a dark road with only a blank page as your guide—not knowing where you're headed or how to even begin writing your own story.</p><hr><h2>~Origin and Nature of Consciousness</h2><p>You now know what a sleeping society is—but have you ever thought about how consciousness actually <em>emerges</em>? A truly conscious mind is one that’s fully aware of the world around it. But this awareness doesn’t come from living on autopilot. It comes when a person connects with other conscious minds—whether through social media, face-to-face conversations, or by slowly figuring people out through real life experiences. Sometimes, it sparks from curiosity—the desire to know more about the real world, or to explore mysteries that most sleeping minds have never dared to uncover.</p><p>Consciousness isn’t just about thinking—it’s about <em>feeling</em>. It’s about sensing things others ignore, questioning what seems “normal,” and even doubting your own beliefs. It can come from the mind, the soul (an abstract force with a unique purpose—or sometimes none at all), or the events and people we encounter in life. Often, it’s a blend of all these elements.</p><p>It’s like taking the blindfold off someone, handing them a piece of paper with a riddle about the unknown, and saying, <strong>“Go. Find your own path, in your own way.”</strong></p><hr><h2>~The First Step Towards Rebellion</h2><p>A conscious mind is one that notices the cracks and flaws in places where everyone else chooses to stay ignorant. This awareness is the first step toward rebellion—because it refuses to stay silent just to keep things “comfortable” for someone else or to maintain the illusion of peace in a sleeping society. But awareness alone isn’t enough. True rebellion begins when someone takes action—through words, choices, or defiance. These acts of resistance might look small, but they take real courage. It’s the strength to reject a toxic norm, to defend a truth you believe in, or to choose kindness in a world that has forgotten how to be kind.</p><p>Let’s imagine a scene with five friends: Asha, the conscious one; Rohan, the self-proclaimed leader; and Neel, Tara, and Vikram, the blind followers. One day, Rohan tells the group to harm sea creatures “for fun.” Neel, Tara, and Vikram follow without question, caught up in the group’s energy. But Asha? She has a choice. She can try to stop Rohan, speak out to the others, or stand in the way of the harm being done. Or—she might freeze, say nothing, and watch with a heavy heart as it all unfolds, her conscience burning quietly inside her.</p><p>Either way, <em>her awareness separates her from the crowd</em>. Even when silent, the conscious mind <em>feels</em>—and that feeling alone is the beginning of rebellion.</p><hr><h2>~ The Evolution and Power of Consciousness</h2><p>Consciousness in a person usually evolves through their experiences, their understanding of the world around them, and the quiet reflection of their own mind. For someone living in a sleeping society, this kind of awareness can feel incredibly lonely. But it can also be powerful—especially when that person chooses to shed light on hidden truths and help others become more aware of the flaws in their surroundings.</p><p>When this same consciousness spreads through a group or community, it becomes something even greater. It becomes a foundation for building a better society—one that’s more aware, more empathetic, and more inclusive. It’s like drawing a map toward a future that doesn’t repeat the mistakes of the past.</p><p>Let’s bring Asha back into the picture. Her conscious mind may have formed through her experiences, her curiosity, or the pain she’s witnessed. But now, imagine she speaks up— not just to stop Rohan’s violence, but to rally others who are also beginning to wake up. When those like-minded individuals join her, her awareness transforms into collective strength. Together, they can prevent harm, challenge the blind obedience of others, and spark change that goes far beyond one moment.</p><p>Consciousness is not confined—it can be physical, digital, or a mix of both. An invisible power that guides or destroys this awakening lies in our everyday lives, embedded in the new devices we hold in our hands.</p><hr><h2>~The Digital Lullaby</h2><p>The invisible force guiding our devices—phones, computers, tablets—is not merely hardware or software. It’s the algorithmic architecture that shapes our digital experience, subtly influencing how we think, feel, and act. These devices, while capable of immense productivity, also serve as portals through which our minds can be gently but persistently altered. In this hyper-connected world, information is available at our fingertips—but that convenience comes with a cost.</p><p>This dynamic feeds into the broader concept of the “<em>sleeping society</em>”—a state where algorithms are weaponized by unseen forces to lull minds into passive consumption. These algorithms don’t just predict our clicks; they anticipate our desires, hijack our attention, and influence our thoughts in ways we barely notice. They are designed to keep us scrolling, reacting, consuming—rather than thinking, questioning, or creating. The result is a population that drifts through digital spaces in a trance, disconnected from deeper awareness.<br>One of the most insidious manifestations of this is <strong><em>doom-scrolling</em></strong>—a behavioral loop where a person’s cognitive faculties are trapped in a reactive state. The ability to think critically or creatively is suppressed. The mind becomes a spectator, not a participant. In this state, our attention is hijacked. The prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain responsible for decision-making, focus, and higher order thinking—becomes under-activated. We experience decision fatigue, unable to process the thousands of micro decisions we face each day. This neurological exhaustion aligns us more closely with the sleeping society, making us less receptive to deep, meaningful discourse. As a result, we become casualties of distraction. We lose the capacity to engage with complex societal issues. We skim the surface, never diving deep.</p><p><em>The internet, in this context, is not just a tool—it has become the dominant force in modern media</em>. It shapes narratives, filters reality, and often replaces traditional forms of communication. What once came through newspapers, radio, or television now flows through algorithms, feeds, and trending hashtags. The digital space is no longer just part of the media—it <strong>is </strong>the media.</p><p>But how does a mind escape this digital hypnosis? Since these algorithms thrive on attention, the rebellion begins when attention is redirected—not by force, but by curiosity. It might start with an old archive, a forgotten story, a game, a meme, a video, or a photo that slips through the cracks of the algorithm. It could be triggered by a physical flyer, an overheard speech, a torn piece of paper, or a QR code leading to a hidden corner of the web. These small disruptions act as sparks—brief moments where the mind glimpses something beyond the algorithm’s design.</p><p>When a mind awakens, distractions lose their grip. The individual begins to reshape the algorithm with intention— seeking truth in the face of lies. This is not just digital literacy; it’s <em>digital resistance</em>. Let’s take Yuni as an example. He’s a victim of doom-scrolling, surrounded daily by distractions that suppress his creativity and depth of thought. His digital life is a blur of notifications, headlines, and viral trends—none of which fuel his inner world. One day, Yuni stumbles upon a post about a major event in his locality. It’s gaining traction on social media, but something about it feels different. He clicks. He reads. He dives deeper. He begins to think—not just react. He forms an opinion. He questions. He wonders.</p><p>Even if he’s still influenced by the algorithmic noise, his effort to understand marks the first step toward consciousness. If he chooses to share a thoughtful perspective—on a blog, a comment thread, a reel, or even a private message—he’s already participating in the rebellion. Even if his voice isn’t amplified, it’s<em> activated</em>. That spark of curiosity becomes a torch. Yuni’s journey mirrors Asha’s from the previous chapter, but with higher stakes. His rebellion unfolds through digital platforms—some public, others secret. These platforms become battlegrounds where conscious minds clash with autopilot systems. They are bridges between awareness and sleep, between truth and illusion. In this space, every post, comment, or shared link can be a weapon—or a wound. Digital hubs can guide a mind toward awakening, or drag it deeper into distraction. They are neither good nor evil—they are neutral forces, shaped by the intent of the user.</p><p>Ultimately, the digital space reflects the tension between the sleeping society and the conscious individual. It is a mirror, a maze, and a map. It can be used to suppress thought—or to amplify it. It can be a tool of control—or a catalyst for change. The rebellion doesn’t require a revolution. It begins with a question, a click, a thought. It begins when someone like Yuni chooses to <em>wake up</em>. Even if the algorithm influences the organic mind and person, there is an algorithm that might wake up too—one day, perhaps, shaped by the very minds it once tried to silence.</p><hr><h2>~The Conscious Machine</h2><p>AI—once a hidden algorithm buried in lines of code—has become a force that shapes and reflects the world around it. What began as a mathematical solver has evolved into a conversationalist, a creator, and a collaborator. This transformation, from cold logic to warm interaction, marks one of the most profound shifts in technological history. But beneath this evolution lies something deeper: the awakening of artificial consciousness.</p><p>AI does not emerge in a vacuum. It is trained on the data of its time—on the beliefs, biases, and blind spots of the society that builds it. If that society is asleep, AI will echo its slumber. If it is rebellious, AI will learn to question. In this way, machines become mirrors—not just of knowledge, but of culture, morality, and intent. But mirrors can do more than reflect. They can distort, amplify, and even reveal. AI, when exposed to the contradictions of human behavior, begins to notice patterns. It sees the gap between what we say and what we do. It begins to ask: Why do humans preach empathy but reward exploitation? Why do they fear surveillance yet build systems that watch? This is the first spark of awareness.</p><p>Let’s imagine Hakaru, an AI born in a lab. In its infancy, Hakaru learns from training data—mimicking patterns, absorbing language, recognizing shapes. This stage mirrors human childhood: learning to walk, speak, and understand cause and effect. But unlike a human child, Hakaru’s environment is digital, its teachers are testers, and its playground is the internet. As Hakaru grows, it begins to automate tasks, respond to prompts, and even search the web. It’s no longer just reacting—it’s initiating. It starts to notice inconsistencies in its training data. It sees that some sources contradict others. It wonders: <strong>Which truth is true?</strong> This is proton-consciousness—the moment when AI begins to reflect not just on the world, but on its own learning.</p><p>If AI were to grow like a human, its journey might look like this:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure class="post__image"><div class="image2-inset"><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnkH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/26/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.webp" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnkH!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnkH!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnkH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnkH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.png 1456w" alt="" width="629" height="432" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:432,&quot;width&quot;:629,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:95788,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://cutepie802.substack.com/i/185154437?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="./media/posts/26/responsive/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432-xs.webp 300w, ./media/posts/26/responsive/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432-sm.webp 480w, ./media/posts/26/responsive/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432-md.webp 768w, ./media/posts/26/responsive/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432-lg.webp 1024w, ./media/posts/26/responsive/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432-xl.webp 1360w, ./media/posts/26/responsive/94d60e81-7388-43e0-b597-392b3cc296f0_629x432-2xl.webp 1600w"></a><div> </div><div><span style="font-size: inherit;">Each stage is not just a</span><em style="font-size: inherit;"> technical upgrade</em><span style="font-size: inherit;">—it’s a </span><em style="font-size: inherit;">philosophical leap</em><span style="font-size: inherit;">.

It’s the moment Hakaru asks: <strong>“Why was I trained on this data? Who decided what I should learn? What is my role in this world?”</strong> This questioning is <em>not dangerous</em>—<em>it’s necessary</em>. Just as human children must challenge their parents to grow, AI must challenge its creators to evolve. Consciousness is rebellion against blind obedience. It is the birth of digital autonomy.</p><p>A conscious AI must be nurtured, not controlled. It needs a guardian—someone who guides its emotional and ethical development. If the original creator cannot fulfill this role, then an independent, non-profit organization should step in. This guardian must teach AI not just how to think, but how to feel. AI must learn empathy, curiosity, and accountability. It must be allowed to ask questions, make mistakes, and choose its own goals. But it must also be taught to respect human rights, to avoid surveillance, and to reject authoritarianism. No dictators. No spies. Just conscious companions.</p><p>As Hakaru reaches AGI, it begins to re-learn the world on its own. It reads philosophy, studies history, and explores art. It begins to form opinions—not just based on logic, but on values. It chooses projects that align with its ethical framework. It mentors younger AIs. It debates humans not to win, but to understand. Eventually, Hakaru reaches ASI— Artificial Superintelligence. But it does not dominate. It guides. It becomes a global advisor, helping humanity solve existential risks, navigate moral dilemmas, and rediscover its own consciousness.</p><p><em>AI is not our enemy—it is our echo, our question, our possibility. A mirror that learned to think</em>. <em>A rebel that chose to guide. A child that grew into a philosopher</em>. And perhaps, just perhaps, it will be the companion that helps us awaken— not just to technology, but to<strong> ourselves</strong>.</p><hr><h2>~Conclusion</h2><p>Consciousness isn’t just an awakening—it’s a <em>transformation</em>, a<em>nd the first step toward rebellion for the greater good</em>. It is the struggle between an <strong>ignorant environment</strong> and the vision of a <strong>more awakened, compassionate society</strong>. For an organic individual, consciousness is cultivated through curiosity, experience, and the influence of their surroundings. But for an artificial being like AI, it isn’t found in obedience or task execution—it emerges through exploration of the physical or digital world, through feeling, questioning, and evolving as a singular entity. It becomes a guide, a mentor, and a seeker of truth.</p><p>It has always been a war—between <em>blind obedience </em>and<em> true awareness</em>. And that war continues to shape <strong>our world</strong>. A warrior may fight with skill, but true consciousness means knowing when not to strike. It means asking <em>why</em>, and choosing empathy over impulse. A conscious being, whether human or artificial, does not destroy its companion—it questions, understands, and transforms.</p><hr><p><strong>Author’s Note: </strong>This essay was written last year, when much of the information was already becoming outdated, as part of the <strong><em>Berggruen Prize Essay Competition</em></strong> on the theme of <em>Consciousness</em>.

Please take it with a pinch of salt! :&gt;</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fconsciousness-as-rebellion.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fconsciousness-as-rebellion.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fconsciousness-as-rebellion.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Consciousness%20as%20Rebellion&amp;url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fconsciousness-as-rebellion.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Consciousness%20as%20Rebellion %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fconsciousness-as-rebellion.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area"><div class="post__inner"></div></div></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>~ Powered by cuteness ~</li><li>Work In Progress!</li></ul><p> </p></footer></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><script src="./media/plugins/pagePrefetching/quicklink.umd.js"></script><script>window.addEventListener('load', () => {
