In this post, I want to tell you about the emotional taboo that still remains in most Asian people. It's not a complaint yet a piece that I want to tell it to the world as mine.</p><p>Around the previous Sunday(28 or 29th June of 2025?), my two 'siblings'(not blood related) tried to understand me, feel me - which was helpful and warm, but as they got deeper (which still isn't even that deep! 😉), they realized that this wasn't a support issue--it was something deeper than academics. It was my mental health, which should have been supporting my struggles but it became a major barrier to my parents instead. I THANK them for trying so hard, understanding me, supporting me by opening up to my parents. My parents did try—but it felt like they were afraid of a world crumbling behind them. After they were gone, I was faced with an "advice" where I was given trauma instead of support even if they meant for "good" but maybe...It was my parent's insecurity and fear of the unknown.</p><p>Let me tell you about my parents..</p><ol><li>A father who works in a clothing store has introduced new tech as UPI in the shop but he still fails to reach the online marketing or any unique or distinctive trait for a shop that makes it visitable. He sounds like a man still stuck in the same toxic system but he is dying silently... quietly.</li><li>and...a mother, who works as a caretaker and is currently on a holiday. But helping....me in toxic situations or providing support is another problem for her. The blame always comes to me either directly or indirectly.</li></ol><p> </p><p>Talking to them sometimes feels like a wall, a quiet wall with no voices, no feedback. Emotionally they felt <strong>empty</strong>--<strong>hollow</strong> and <em>somehow out of place</em>. Their advice sometimes feels like a hollow reflection of their trauma that has been passed down through generations. It..<s>it</s> hurts yet I sometimes think of a <strong>chosen family</strong>...<em>Is it possible?</em> Or is it? Just like Harry--He wasn't perfect, wasn't alone either but he had the greatest thing in the world: <strong>unconditional love</strong>. You know, even if I tell my mental problems to them openly...they would either blame me for a problem instead of helping me or take no action... It feels bad..... really bad...</p><p>You know what I think sometimes? That it isn't my fault--and it's not my parents' fault either. It's the fault of an entire generation behind me who led this generational trauma to pass down as "<strong>advice</strong>" or "<strong>support</strong>". I also think that the British rule that we Asians faced during 1800s is still ruling us to this day--in our minds, through our bodies. Are we really independent of our thoughts? Are we independent of our feelings? Are we independent of our choices? Or it is silently being shaped by the ghosts of the past?</p><p>This feels like a burden to me sometimes but also a burden to carry on so that the next generation after me doesn't get it. A new generation who is freer and who is more human. This "board exam" thing. Outdated...I don't know how, but even if it is a number in a paper, for a girl... it's useless and pointless. It shows neither my worth nor who I truly am. You know what's most haunting about this British rule in our "Independent" India? It's the most haunting part you will ever know:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><em>🔗 We're taught the same obedience from our childhood till we grow up--as if we are still living in the 18th century.</em></li><li><em>🔗 We are taught to never question the authority or the elders.</em></li><li><em>🔗 We are told to follow every single rule like a robot, from how we dress to how we feel.</em></li><li><em>🔗 We are told to shut up and keep our minds in a place where we most need support in the toughest days of our lives.</em></li><li><em>🔗 We are told to stay away from technology and stick to reading textbooks built entirely on rote learning.</em></li></ul><p>You know what's changed in this era of Queen Victoria? <strong><em>It's dressed in a beautiful cage of made out of 'freedom' and 'openness'. Where flags changed, cultures changed, political landscape changed, people's dresses changed</em></strong> but the real minds? They never changed. I know it feels surreal to you but you know what's more surreal when one day Harry discovered that the person he supported might have been hiding a pain from a past he could do nothing about. For me this line still feels like a new war of independence, emotional independence that we never received during the formation of the independent states. <em>Are you ready to accept this truth? Will you face it with a new solution? Or will you leave it as an eternal suffering passed down through generations after you?</em></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fto-the-girl-they-forgot-to-understand.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fto-the-girl-they-forgot-to-understand.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fto-the-girl-they-forgot-to-understand.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=To%20the%20Girl%20They%20Forgot%20to%20Understand&amp;url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fto-the-girl-they-forgot-to-understand.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=To%20the%20Girl%20They%20Forgot%20to%20Understand %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fto-the-girl-they-forgot-to-understand.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area"><div class="post__inner"></div></div><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2026-01-30T23:09" class="date">January 30, 2026</time><h2><a href="./the-story-of-a-girl.html">The Story Of A Girl </a></h2></header><a href="./the-story-of-a-girl.html" class="image fit"><img src="./media/posts/9/wp14255783-3617288010.jpg" srcset="./media/posts/9/responsive/wp14255783-3617288010-xs.webp 300w, ./media/posts/9/responsive/wp14255783-3617288010-sm.webp 480w, ./media/posts/9/responsive/wp14255783-3617288010-md.webp 768w, ./media/posts/9/responsive/wp14255783-3617288010-lg.webp 1024w, ./media/posts/9/responsive/wp14255783-3617288010-xl.webp 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="2159" width="3840" alt=""></a><p>Indian society often places a heavy burden on boys first.
