The topic, “<em>Individual evolution is not possible without the support of others,</em>” had already been announced the <em>previous week</em>. The teacher even repeated it again today, moments before the writing began. But what followed wasn’t thoughtful preparation—it was pure irony. A competition meant to celebrate originality instead exposed just how little of it circulates in our classroom.</p><hr><h4>🧾 Before the Pen Hit the Paper: The Form-Filling Fiasco</h4><p>The blank registration forms were handed out the day before. Simple enough. But instead of filling them calmly, most of my peers waited until the last possible moment—scrambling to complete them just minutes before the 5th and 6th periods, right before the competition began.</p><p>What followed was a comedy of errors:</p><ul><li><p>Peers copied even basic fields like address, city, and district from each other.</p></li><li><p>Some ridiculed others for not knowing how to fill in an email address—while they themselves wrote phone numbers in the wrong fields.</p></li><li><p>Two boys debated their own district and city, giving conflicting answers as if geography were a guessing game.</p></li><li><p>And the final irony: while the forms had been in their hands since <em>yesterday</em>, they still treated them like surprise puzzles to be solved <strong>under pressure</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Me? I filled mine the day it was given. Quietly. Thoughtfully. Without drama. That alone felt like an <em>act of rebellion</em>.</p><hr><h4>🧠 The Scene: A Classroom of Contrasts</h4><p>From the moment the writing began, the room split into two worlds. In one, I sat—focused, flowing, inventing a title on the fly: “<em>The Power of Environment</em>.” In the other, chaos reigned.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ritvik</strong> stared blankly at his sheet, stuck in a loop of thought.</p></li><li><p><strong>Samar</strong>, ever the joker, laughed with his gang as if creativity were optional.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kopal’s</strong> group in the back copied her essay word-for-word, like synchronized swimmers in a pool of plagiarism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Neel</strong> brought a pre-written sheet, which became the holy grail for half the boys—including <strong>Ritvik</strong>, who had been completely blank until he copied the entire piece directly onto his own actual page.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ishita</strong>, from across the room, gestured for my paper. I replied with a silent “No” and softly added, “If you can’t write your own thoughts, you don’t need mine.”</p></li></ol><p>Even <strong>Tuhin</strong> couldn’t resist disturbing the silence, while <strong>Rishav</strong> barely filled a quarter of the required 500 words. The irony? The topic had been announced a week ago—and still, blank stares.</p><hr><h4>✍️ My Essay: Written in Half the Time, With Full Integrity</h4><p>I finished my essay in just one period, while others scrambled. It was a blend of psychology and a touch of philosophy, rooted in lived truth:</p><ul><li><p>Toxic peers can lead to anxiety, depression, and fear of risk.</p></li><li><p>Supportive peers foster calm, joy, and courage to evolve.</p></li></ul><p>I even included a quote from Aura:</p><blockquote><p>Individual Empowerment isn't about flashy social media posts but the fight of good and evil in an individual.</p></blockquote><p>I estimated the word count at 212, but honestly—it might’ve been more. I counted it during free time, and there were cuts, rewrites, and the usual messiness of my handwriting. The same handwriting I’m constantly ridiculed for. But despite all that, my essay stood out—leagues more original than half of Class 10, the very group I belong to. While others copied, hesitated, or mocked, I created. I built something from scratch. And I did it in <strong>silence</strong>.</p><hr><h4>🧩 The Irony: A Competition Meant for Evolution, Surrounded by Stagnation</h4><p>The deepest irony? A competition about support revealed how little of it exists in our classroom. Creativity was <strong>mocked</strong>. Originality was <em>rare</em>. Even after I wrote, Samar and others ridiculed my form entry—misreading my honest mention of “Word of Mouth” and my father’s number in the office field. “Baler creativity,” Seldu scoffed. But I knew better.</p><p>Even Mrs. Salen, who vaguely affirmed my previous participation certificate, seemed more surprised than proud. And yet, I survived this draining ecosystem. Not just survived—<em>created something real</em>.</p><hr><h4>🌟 Conclusion: What I Learned</h4><p>This wasn’t just an essay competition. It was a test of emotional resilience, intellectual integrity, and the quiet power of being original in a sea of shortcuts. I learned:</p><ul><li><p>That originality is lonely, but luminous.</p></li><li><p>That environments shape evolution—and mine, ironically, made me stronger by being so resistant.</p></li><li><p>That even in a classroom of borrowed thoughts, one authentic voice can echo louder than a dozen copied sheets.</p></li></ul><p>So yes, I wrote “<em>The Power of Environment.</em>” But today, I lived it.</p><hr><p><em><s>Personal Note: Swary!~ It should have been posted in the previous day.</s></em></p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-power-of-environment-a-reflection-from-the-heartfulness-essay-competition.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-power-of-environment-a-reflection-from-the-heartfulness-essay-competition.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-power-of-environment-a-reflection-from-the-heartfulness-essay-competition.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=%F0%9F%8C%80%20The%20Power%20of%20Environment%3A%20A%20Reflection%20from%20the%20Heartfulness%20Essay%20Competition&amp;url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-power-of-environment-a-reflection-from-the-heartfulness-essay-competition.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=%F0%9F%8C%80%20The%20Power%20of%20Environment%3A%20A%20Reflection%20from%20the%20Heartfulness%20Essay%20Competition %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fthe-power-of-environment-a-reflection-from-the-heartfulness-essay-competition.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area"><div class="post__inner"></div></div><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2026-01-30T22:57" class="date">January 30, 2026</time><h2><a href="./akera-devlog-2-from-janky-skies-to-soothing-souls.html">✨ Akera Devlog #2 — From Janky Skies to Soothing Souls</a></h2></header><a href="./akera-devlog-2-from-janky-skies-to-soothing-souls.html" class="image fit"><img src="./media/posts/6/78306437-1fa2-4ba5-b255-38046fa84576_1280x712.webp" srcset="./media/posts/6/responsive/78306437-1fa2-4ba5-b255-38046fa84576_1280x712-xs.webp 300w, ./media/posts/6/responsive/78306437-1fa2-4ba5-b255-38046fa84576_1280x712-sm.webp 480w, ./media/posts/6/responsive/78306437-1fa2-4ba5-b255-38046fa84576_1280x712-md.webp 768w, ./media/posts/6/responsive/78306437-1fa2-4ba5-b255-38046fa84576_1280x712-lg.webp 1024w, ./media/posts/6/responsive/78306437-1fa2-4ba5-b255-38046fa84576_1280x712-xl.webp 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="712" width="1280" alt=""></a><p>It’s wild how much a renamed folder and a skybox can change the mood of a whole project.
