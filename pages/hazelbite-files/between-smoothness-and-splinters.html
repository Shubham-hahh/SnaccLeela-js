I woke up feeling peaceful, as usual. Yet the moment I touched my face, I felt the <strong>coarse inches</strong> of hair growing there — sharp, pointy, like <em>sandpaper against my skin</em>. I glanced at my hands, right and left, noticing the prominent hair that had grown across them. I stood up quietly, did my morning chores, and waited until my parents left the <strong>house</strong>…</p><p>That small sense of space gave me permission to act — to remove the coarseness, the prominent hair I kept seeing. I picked up my dad’s razor (with his permission!~) and went to the sink. Splashing water on my face felt like preparation, like washing away the itch before battle. I stood before the mirror, applied shaving cream to the rough spots, and raised the razor to erase <em>the problem</em>.</p><p>The blade slid across my skin, catching hair in the cream. There was so much — small chunks clinging together like a <strong>rebellion on my face</strong>. I sighed inwardly, with Nayari beside me, and pressed on to remove the last bits. Still, it wasn’t enough. I rinsed, reapplied cream, and shaved again, determined to smooth away every hidden corner of stubble. The beard felt like cactus spines against my fingers, and I longed for softness. Even when no hair was visible, I ran the razor one final time, chasing the comfort of smooth cheeks.</p><p>When I rinsed my face clean, freedom brushed against me. My chin was nearly smooth, my skin<em> lighter</em>, <strong>calmer</strong>. But the mission wasn’t finished. I carried the cup, razor, and cream to the bathroom, determined to tackle the hair on my hands.</p><p>I removed my shirt and looked at them — hair, even if small, still there. Something stirred in me. I filled a bucket with cold water, the chill of the season biting yet comforting, promising relief. I scooped water with the mug, poured it over my hands, and applied shaving cream as though I were caring for myself. With delicate strokes, I ran the razor across my right hand, careful not to harm, only to free. My elbow too bore hair, so I repeated the ritual — cream, blade, rinse. When I touched my right hand, it was smooth, glowing in the light. Freedom, calmness, indescribable. And in that glow, I felt the freedom of hair flowing despite near-smooth skin — a<em> paradox</em> that brought me a little<strong> hope</strong>, especially across my hands and elbows.</p><p>I did the same for my left hand. Yet at the end, a tiny patch of hair remained — stubborn, noticeable, like a splinter lodged beneath the skin of my sight. I rinsed, reapplied, shaved again, but it refused to vanish. Smoothed, yes, but still there, mocking me with its persistence. My fingers kept returning to that spot, tracing it as if to confirm the imperfection, each touch sharpening the frustration. I sighed in resignation, rinsed away the debris, and accepted the mix of defeat and relief.</p><p>Looking at my chest, I saw little patches of hair, but nearly smooth overall. Another sigh. I dried myself, put on my shirt, and cleaned the bathroom quietly. Back in my room, I noticed a small cut on my left hand — the razor wasn’t meant for body hair, only for coarse facial strands. I applied medicine gently, hoping it would heal soon. It didn’t hurt, but it reminded me of the limits of <em>my tools</em>.</p><p>Relieved, I looked at my body and felt a quiet permission to be myself. I returned to my day, though the hair grew back — on my face most prominently, and elsewhere in small but insistent ways. I sighed again, resigned yet annoyed, knowing I would shave my face once more, while softly delaying the battle against the rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Personal Note: </strong>I’m back to writing!~ This piece is different from my earlier ones, part of the new model. It reflects my dysphoria with beard and body hair — the fumbling, the cutting, the ritual of removal. And an update: Aura is now Nayari. Why? Because “Aura” often gets confused with the Gen Z vibe term, and I wanted to upgrade her name to something clearer, stronger.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fbetween-smoothness-and-splinters.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fbetween-smoothness-and-splinters.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fbetween-smoothness-and-splinters.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Between%20Smoothness%20and%20Splinters%C2%A0&amp;url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fbetween-smoothness-and-splinters.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Between%20Smoothness%20and%20Splinters%C2%A0 %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fbetween-smoothness-and-splinters.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area"><div class="post__inner"></div></div><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2026-01-30T23:52" class="date">January 30, 2026</time><h2><a href="./scientific-spiritualism-the-balance-between-logic-and-hope.html">Scientific Spiritualism: The Balance Between Logic and Hope</a></h2></header><a href="./scientific-spiritualism-the-balance-between-logic-and-hope.html" class="image fit"><img src="./media/posts/21/4793cfce-9b32-4fba-8ac3-756a4cc1a9b0_2560x1440.webp" srcset="./media/posts/21/responsive/4793cfce-9b32-4fba-8ac3-756a4cc1a9b0_2560x1440-xs.webp 300w, ./media/posts/21/responsive/4793cfce-9b32-4fba-8ac3-756a4cc1a9b0_2560x1440-sm.webp 480w, ./media/posts/21/responsive/4793cfce-9b32-4fba-8ac3-756a4cc1a9b0_2560x1440-md.webp 768w, ./media/posts/21/responsive/4793cfce-9b32-4fba-8ac3-756a4cc1a9b0_2560x1440-lg.webp 1024w, ./media/posts/21/responsive/4793cfce-9b32-4fba-8ac3-756a4cc1a9b0_2560x1440-xl.webp 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="444" width="848" alt=""></a><p>This ideology is close to my heart.
