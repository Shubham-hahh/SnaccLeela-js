But behind those top ranks and perfect scores lies a growing mental health crisis that can no longer be ignored.</p><p>A study published on <strong>PubMed</strong> reveals a disturbing connection: academic stress is tightly linked to depression and even suicidal thoughts. And it’s not just happening here. In the U.S., <strong>over 60% of college students</strong> reported mental health challenges during the 2020–2021 academic year, largely due to academic performance anxiety.</p><p>Here’s what’s even more telling—schools that invest in student well-being, such as by hiring more mental health professionals, see real results. Students thrive when they're supported as human beings, not just as grade generators.</p><p>But mental health isn’t just about therapy rooms or awareness posters. It’s about <em>culture</em>. It’s about creating a school environment where creativity, curiosity, and passion are celebrated, not crushed under the weight of expectation.</p><p>Studies have shown that <strong>creative expression</strong>—through art, music, writing, or even open-ended learning—can improve both academic and emotional outcomes. A connected, expressive student is a motivated one. When students feel safe to dream, they also begin to grow.</p><p>And let’s talk about how we learn. Our education system is still stuck in a rut of <strong>rote memorization</strong>—burning midnight oil to cram facts that vanish the next morning. But smarter study methods like <strong>practice testing</strong> and <strong>distributed practice</strong> have been proven to boost long-term understanding and cognitive flexibility. It’s not about studying <em>more</em>, it’s about studying <em>better</em>.</p><p>In fact, <strong>rote learning</strong> limits our ability to apply knowledge in real-life situations. That’s not education—that’s just programming. True education happens when <em>we understand</em>, not <em>when we recite.</em></p><p>Need proof? Look at <strong>Dr. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan</strong>, the Indian-American-British Nobel Laureate in Chemistry (2009). His breakthrough in understanding the structure of ribosomes wasn’t the result of memorizing textbooks—it came from curiosity, deep thinking, and creative exploration.</p><p>And yet, many students today feel like robots—pushed by cultural expectations, judged by marks, and emotionally misunderstood. The question remains: <em>Do parents truly understand what their children are going through mentally?</em> Or are they chasing dreams that were never their children’s to begin with?</p><p>If we want a future where students don’t burn out before they bloom, we need to <strong>change the narrative</strong>.</p><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>✅ Prioritize mental health</li><li>✅ Embrace creative learning</li><li>✅ End toxic academic competition</li><li>✅ Encourage smarter—not harder—study habits</li><li>✅ Listen to students. Truly listen.</li></ul><p>It’s time for a mindset shift. A society that values emotional intelligence alongside academic success is one that thrives in every direction. Let’s build schools—and homes—that feel more like safe spaces and less like pressure cookers.</p><p>Because the cost of ignoring mental health? It’s too high.</p><p>And our students deserve better.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Frethinking-academic-pressure-why-mental-health-needs-a-seat-at-the-desk.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Frethinking-academic-pressure-why-mental-health-needs-a-seat-at-the-desk.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Frethinking-academic-pressure-why-mental-health-needs-a-seat-at-the-desk.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Rethinking%20Academic%20Pressure%3A%20Why%20Mental%20Health%20Needs%20a%20Seat%20at%20the%20Desk&amp;url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Frethinking-academic-pressure-why-mental-health-needs-a-seat-at-the-desk.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Rethinking%20Academic%20Pressure%3A%20Why%20Mental%20Health%20Needs%20a%20Seat%20at%20the%20Desk %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Frethinking-academic-pressure-why-mental-health-needs-a-seat-at-the-desk.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area"><div class="post__inner"></div></div></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>~ Powered by cuteness ~</li><li>Work In Progress!</li></ul><p> </p></footer></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><script src="./media/plugins/pagePrefetching/quicklink.umd.js"></script><script>window.addEventListener('load', () => {
